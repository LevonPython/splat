These tests cover:
- Parameter setting and validation
- Segment coverage parameters
- File path handling
- Boolean flags
- Command line argument generation

Additional tests you might want to add:
1. Error handling tests
2. Boundary value tests for numerical parameters
3. Integration tests with actual file I/O
4. Memory leak tests
5. Performance tests for large datasets

Remember to:
1. Install Google Test framework
2. Make your code more testable by:
 - Separating concerns
 - Making dependencies injectable
 - Adding appropriate getters/setters for testing
3. Add more specific test cases based on your requirements
4. Consider adding mock objects for file operations and external dependencies
5. Add test coverage reporting
